## Due to new blocking measures by YouTube, my instance and most others are temporarily broken.
I recommend exporting your subscriptions by logging in [here](https://piped.r4fo.com/login) and then going to [this page](https://piped.r4fo.com/subscriptions)

Now you can create an account at another instance (for example, the official one: [piped.video](https://piped.video)) and import them on the preferences page

More info regarding the YT blocking measure can be found here: [GitHub issue](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped/issues/3658)
