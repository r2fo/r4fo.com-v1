It's been nearly 2 months since my last post but don’t worry — I haven’t received any C&Ds (yet). We're still operating as usual

Today, I’m thrilled to unveil not one, but two fresh additions to our collection of search engines:

- [MiniSearch](https://ai.r4fo.com): A fork of SearXNG but it comes with a little AI assistent that helps you at finding what you need. I tried it and it's great at finding little specific things. Don't worry about spying, the LLM **runs locally** on your device and as usual I [don't](https://r4fo.com/privacypolicy) store logs. However, for the best experience I recommend using it on a PC. ([sourcecode](https://gothub.com/felladrin/MiniSearch))

- [Whoogle](https://whoogle.r4fo.com): Imagine Google's results but without the prying eyes. Yes, that's possible. If SearXNG or MiniSearch aren't returning good results, maybe try Whoogle! ([sourcecode](https://gothub.com/benbusby/whoogle-search))

As always, this is only possible thanks to your contributions. Everything is hosted voluntarily and provided free of charge to everyone. If you appreciate these instances, please consider [❤️ donating](https://r4fo.com/donate) so R4fo.com can continue operating

*(as a bonus: I have reorganized the [services page](https://r4fo.com/services) and categorized everything)*
