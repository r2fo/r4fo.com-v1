As you may know from [this](https://r4fo.com/posts/new-server/) post, I use a reverse proxy for some 'problematic' services to counter fake content claims.

As a quick transparency update: I have just migrated that server to another provider called [BuyVM](https://buyvm.net). This was needed due to recent policy changes with the previous provider.

Nothing has changed for you. This post is just informational
