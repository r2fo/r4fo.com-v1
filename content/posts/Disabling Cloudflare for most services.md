Today, I have disabled Cloudflare's Proxy for most of my services. I have realized that my infrastructure has outgrown the need for a 24/7 [MITM](https://wikiless.r4fo.com/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) by a third party. Cloudflare offers a lot of benefits to r4fo.com, including a [CDN](https://wikiless.r4fo.com/wiki/Content_delivery_network) and a [WAF](https://wikiless.r4fo.com/wiki/Web_application_firewall), but unfortunately with that comes the added privacy disadvantage.

Cloudflare's Proxy will still be enabled for these services, to protect them against bots wasting bandwidth and for CDN purposes:
- [Piped](https://piped.r4fo.com)
- [SafeTwitch](https://safetwitch.r4fo.com)
~~- [ProxiTok](https://proxitok.r4fo.com)~~
- [RedLib](https://redlib.r4fo.com)
- [Nitter](https://nitter.r4fo.com)

Edit [21 Jun 2024]: Cloudflare Proxy has been disabled for ProxiTok
