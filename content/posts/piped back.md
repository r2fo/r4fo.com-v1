This post is my explanation of the Piped instance's 1 week downtime;

YouTube recently introduced a new block that requires login to watch videos <br>
I tried a lot of things, like rebooting, reinstalling and rotating IP's <br>
But they had blacklisted my entire IPv6 /64 <br>
Due to exams I didn't have time to really go into depth to fix it.
<br>

~~Today I finally found a little bit of time to deploy a new VPS in New York ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (because I had some free credit there) and I migrated Piped to there.~~ <br>
~~Unfortunately there is some latency, but at least it works now.~~ I have also created a [Mastodan account](https://mastodon.social/@r4fo) where I post these kind of short status updates

I apologize for the downtime

### Edit: As of June 16th 2024 the Piped instance has been fixed and is working fine

### Edit [June 23th 2024]: Please read my notice on Piped's hidden service [here](https://status.r4fo.com)
