As you may know, YouTube came with a new block that requires clients to login to watch videos. <br>
I tried everything I could (like rebooting, reinstalling and rotating IPv6) but it seems like they blocked my whole IPv6 /64 block. <br>
Due to time constraints and exams I couldn't really go into depth to fix it. 

But today I've deployed a VPS in New York (since I had some free credit at a provider) and I migrated Piped to there. It works, but of course there is some latency.

**This is a temporary solution** until I find time to bypass the blockage on RafoDE
