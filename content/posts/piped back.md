### 2 June 2024

This post is my explanation of the Piped instance's 1 week downtime;

YouTube recently introduced a new block that requires login to watch videos <br>
I tried a lot of things, like rebooting, reinstalling and rotating IP's <br>
But they had blacklisted my entire IPv6 /64 <br>
Due to exams I didn't have time to really go into depth to fix it.
<br>

Today I finally found a little bit of time to deploy a new VPS in New York ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (because I had some free credit there) and I migrated Piped to there. <br>
Unfortunately there is some latency, but at least it works now. I have also created a [Mastodon account](https://mastodon.social/@r4fo) where I post these kind of short status updates

I apologize for the downtime

### 16 June 2024

I am now routing all Piped traffic through a VPN, everything is working again but I need to rotate VPN servers every day to avoid disruption.  
The New York VPS is no longer in service, Piped is running from Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª again

### 8 September 2024

It seems like most VPN servers have been IP banned by YouTube.  
Many Piped instances do not work anymore, including mine  
Unfortunately there is nothing I can do at this moment and Iâ€™m currently waiting to see how the situation develops
