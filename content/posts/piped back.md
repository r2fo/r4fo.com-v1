### 2 June 2024

YT recently introduced a new block that requires login to watch videos <br>
I tried a lot of things, like rebooting, reinstalling and rotating IP's <br>
But they had blacklisted my entire IPv6 /64 <br>
Due to exams I didn't have time to really go into depth to fix it.
<br>

### 14 June 2024

Today I finally found a little bit of time to work on this issue.  
I've deployed a new VPS in New York ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (because I had some free credit there) and I migrated Piped to there. <br>
Unfortunately there is some latency, but at least it works now. I have also created a [Mastodon account](https://mastodon.social/@r4fo) where I post these kind of short status updates

### 15 June 2024

YT has IP banned the New York VPS

### 16 June 2024

I have migrated Piped back to the German VPS  
I am now routing it through a VPN, everything is working again and I have a script to rotate VPN servers daily to avoid disruption    
The New York VPS is no longer in service  

### August 2024

YT has started banning some VPN servers, making me have to manually rotate VPN servers every day   

### 8 September 2024

It seems like most VPN servers have been IP banned by YT  
Many Piped instances do not work anymore, including mine  
Unfortunately there is nothing I can do at this moment and Iâ€™m currently waiting to see how the situation develops
