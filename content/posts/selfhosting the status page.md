Today, I've acquired a new server in Amsterdam 🇳🇱. This server will now be the home of the status page and will keep a close eye on all services. I've opted for [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) because, for me, it's the top-notch choice for uptime monitoring.

This switch is a big win for my infrastructure's security and privacy. By relying less on outside parties, I am stepping up on control and protection.
