R4fo.com Warrant Canary
=======================
Inspired by IVPN's warrant canary

This warrant canary is updated at least once per month with: 
- A declaration that, up to that point;
    No warrants have been served
    No searches or seizures have taken place
    No backdoors have been implemented or requested
    No data has been disclosed to any third party
    No traffic logging is conducted
    We have not been forced to start logging traffic
- The hash of the latest Monero block to proof that the update could not have been created prior to that date.

While signing the declaration makes it impossible for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations, it does not prevent them from using force to coerce us to produce false declarations.
Please take note if this message is modified, not updated or is removed from this page entirely.
